#UTG

This code generates feasible university timetables using genetic algorithms. This was created in order to get data for my university final project.

You can choose the selection method, as well as the mutation rate.

The available selection methods are:
- Tournament
- Binary tournament
- Roulette wheel
- Linear rank
- Stochastic universal sampling

Although the mutation rate is up to you, the  values used during the development of the project are between 0.01 and 0.1
